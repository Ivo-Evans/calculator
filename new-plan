A new plan for the calculator.

Keep the backend exactly as it is, but make it more user-friendly by:

1) limiting the number of available characters to adjust for screen size
  1.1) text input field should have maxlength property of n and size property of n - or maybe size n is a problematic conflict with css?
  1.2) when you call resolve(exp), call resolve(exp).toPrecision(n)
  1.3) n should be a global variable defined at beginning
2) styling this motherf***er up
  2.1) always centered - sizes as % of screen size
  2.2) no grid lines dividing buttons or anything
  2.3) when you press down a button - even on the keyboard - it lights up green for a bit
  2.4) a ? button which replaces the screen with instructions
  2.5) monospace font


3) LET'S GET THIS THING USING GRID
